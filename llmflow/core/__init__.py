LLMFlow - A powerful framework for building AI agents based on GAME methodology
(Goals, Actions, Memory, Environment).

Core Package - The foundational components of the LLMFlow framework.
This package contains the core modules that implement the modern CPL-first
workflow:
- Goals: Goal tracking and management (goals.py)
- Memory: Conversation history and context management (memory.py)
- Agent: CPL orchestrator that generates and executes plans (agent.py)
- Base utilities shared across the runtime (base.py)

Each module is designed to work together seamlessly while maintaining
clear separation of concerns and robust error handling.
